# Tumblr AdAway

A simple ad-blocker for the Android Tumblr app.

## Requirements

- A rooted Android phone
- [Xposed framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/xposed-installer-versions-changelog-t2714053)
  ([Lollipop version](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811))
- [Tumblr app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr&hl=en), obviously ;-)

## Note

Due to the ever-changing nature of software, only the latest version of
the Tumblr app is supported. You may download an older version of
Tumblr AdAway, but no support will be given for those versions.

## Download

Download a pre-built APK [here](https://bitbucket.org/crossbowffs/tumblradaway/downloads),
or build the app yourself (it only takes a few seconds!)

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for any damage caused by the use of this software,
up to and including having your Tumblr account banned, unintentionally
reblogging NSFW posts, or starting World War III. Use at your own risk.
